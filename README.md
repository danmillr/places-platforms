## Land Acknowledgements

**Cornell University** is located on the traditional homelands of the **GayogoÌ±hÃ³:nÇ«Ê¼ (Cayuga Nation)**, members of the **Haudenosaunee Confederacy**. We acknowledge the dispossession of the GayogoÌ±hÃ³:nÇ«Ê¼ and honor their ongoing connection to these lands and waters.

**The Tata Innovation Center (NYC)** is located on the unceded homelands of the **Lenape people**. We honor their deep ties to Lenapehoking, Land of the People, and recognize the persistence of Lenape communities despite centuries of displacement and erasure.

## Course Summary

**Places / Platforms** is the final course in a three-part skills sequence in urban design. The course guides students in creating experimental spatial platforms that combine urban data, narrative, and design. The focus is on East Harlem, NYC, where students will investigate urban infrastructures through fieldwork, data collection, storytelling, and digital prototyping. The final project includes both a platform (design system) and a methodological narrative.

---

## Rationale

Places are layered with memory, culture, and lived experienceâ€”some legible to data, others resistant. Platforms structure how cities are sensed, represented, and governed. This course interrogates these layers and their tensions, encouraging students to reimagine platforms as tools of equity, participation, and critique.

---

## Course Objectives

Students will:
- Advance experimental urban data methods and alternative cartographies
- Build hybrid site-specific data gathering techniques
- Engage data ethics and positionality in spatial research
- Critique and reverse-engineer dominant data systems
- Prototype and document alternative platforms
- Develop tools that combine data logic (back-end) and interface (front-end)
- Work across media: dashboards, atlases, sensor kits, spatial systems
- Produce thoughtful narratives embedded in their platform design
- Support their design studio work with analytical depth

| Component                      | Description                                                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lectures & Discussions        | Conceptual grounding in platforms, critical mapping, data ethics |
| Technical Workshops           | GIS, mapping, visualization, sensing, storytelling tools         |
| Fieldwork & Labs              | East Harlem research through walking, sketching, sensing         |
| Critiques & Reviews           | Desk crits, peer feedback, and invited reviews                   |
| Seminar Readings              | Group-led discussions on theory and precedent                    |

**Additional Info:**
- Weekly lectures anchor course themes

---

## Final Project

### (1) **Design System (Platform)**
A tool or prototypeâ€”physical, digital, or hybridâ€”that supports urban research and offers a critique of dominant location intelligence logics.

### (2) **Methodological Narrative**
A clear, well-documented explanation of the systemâ€™s construction, values, data sources, ethics, and relevance to site and community.
