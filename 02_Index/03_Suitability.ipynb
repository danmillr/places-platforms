    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to run a MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) presence-only prediction analysis using occurrence points and explanatory variables.\n",
    "The goal is to model the likelihood of presence across a geographic area, even when absence data is unavailable. While we will not use the original MaxEnt Java software directly, this notebook walks through a Python-based approximation using logistic regression.\n",
    "This template is helpful for urban analysis, ecological modeling, or environmental planning projects where students only have point observations of a phenomenon.\n",
